# Group 28: Applying Machine Learning in BioImaging
__Team Members:__ Sean McCann, Vala Masjedizadeh, Michelle Meng, Brandon Hernandaz-Pacheco\

## Project Background: 
There is an unmet need in microbiology for a high throughput bioimage collection and feature engineering pipeline to reduce the cost, time, and difficulty associated with performing machine learning on microscopy datasets. While fluorescence microscopy images are often made available through scientific literature, comprehensive image repositories to study individual proteins in detail by machine learning are not currently existent. Allowing scientists to create personalized bioimage training datasets with their own microscopes will allow users to efficiently share their published experimental results and prepare their data for machine learning based analysis.
