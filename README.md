# Group 28: Applying Machine Learning in Bioimaging
__Team Members:__ Sean McCann, Vala Masjedizadeh, Michelle Meng, Brandon Hernandaz-Pacheco\
__Institution:__ University of California, San Diego\
__PI:__ Dr. Stephanie Fraley

## Project Background: 
There is an unmet need in microbiology for a high throughput bioimage collection and feature engineering pipeline to ease the cost and difficulty of performing machine learning on microscopy datasets. While fluorescence microscopy images are made availible through scientific literature, comprehensive image repositories to study individual proteins in detail with machine learning are not currently avalible.
